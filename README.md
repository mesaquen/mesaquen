# Mesaque Francisco

Hi, I'm Mesaque. I'm a software developer for quite a while now.  

I'm a Linux user (professional usage and at home) and open source lover.

Over the years I had the chance to developed in
- Java
- PHP
- HTML5 + Vanilla JS
- React
- React Native
- Ruby on Rails (while in college)

My love now is for the modern JS stack, mainly frontend.

Currently I'm learning [Vue.js].

Here you'll find some stuff that I developed along the years. Feel to reach me out and ask anything.
